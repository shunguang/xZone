without waiting, it took around 16000 microsecond to receive an image on a windows OS. too slow to archive . ASYNCHRONOUS_PUBLISH_MODE seems not working.

need to move to micron OS

  flow_control_300k_per_sec->max_bytes_per_period = 300 * 1000;
    flow_control_300k_per_sec->period_ms = 1000;
	
300 Hz is the limit on Windows. the program cannot send faster than 300 images per second due to publish (write, ) cannot be ASYNCHRONOUS_PUBLISH_MODE.


HZ < 100, 200 sample's the latency range is between 8000 and 40,000 microsecond, in a wide range
HZ > 125, 200 sample's the latency range is between 8000 and 15,000 microsecond

according these data, it appears sending data slower, and latency is more higher. Why?

it took 1000000/3000 = 3,000 microsecond to prepare images. We may can prepare images and put them in a list, and then publish.

tried to put image to a list, but it seems just a little better (quicker). loop the list seems expensive too.

if you want to build an example from the Fast-DDS library 
- install openssl


To comment code you must perform the following shortcuts in succession

to uncomment code you must do these in succession

### clone sharedmem and tcp examples, as well as defualt helloworldexample

```
git clone --depth=1 --no-checkout https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS
cd Fast-DDS
git sparse-checkout set examples/cpp/dds
git checkout
```

### run the following commands in the example folder that you want to run
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DOPENSSL_INCLUDE_DIR="C:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64\include" ..
cmake --build .
```


### Recursively delete directory on windows in powershell
```
rm -r -fo dir_name
```

if the image size is larger than Maximum transmission unit, it will take longer to send

Determining system maxmium mtu on windows (command prompt)
```
netsh interface ipv4 show subinterface
```

Determining system maxmium mtu on linux
```
ifconfig | grep -i MTU
```

- shared memory will only be faster than udp when there is a lot of data (mbs, gbs)
- udp can be faster with zero-copy networking

These images assume each pixel is 3 bytes (w x h x 3)

formula to get mb
(w * h * 3)/1e6

(first number is WxH)
- 10 x 20 is 600 bytes or 0.0006 mb
- 256 x 144 is 110,592 bytes or 0.110592 mb
- 426 x 240 is 307,720 bytes or 0.30672 mb
- 480 x 360 is 518,400 bytes or 0.5184 mb
- 640 x 480 is 921,600 bytes or 0.9216 mb
- 720 x 480 is 1,036,800 bytes or 1.03 mb
- 1280 x 720 is 2,764,800 bytes or 2.7648 mb
- 1920 x 1080 is 6,220,800 bytes or 6.22 mb
- 4096 x 2160 is 26,542,080 bytes or 26.5 mb
- 7680 x 4320 is 99,532,800 bytes or 99.5 mb
- 15360 Ã— 8640 is 398,131,200 bytes or 398 mb
