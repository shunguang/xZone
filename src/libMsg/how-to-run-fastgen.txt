1. Windows
	assume your working dir is:
	WDIR=C:\Users\wus1\Projects\swu-personal\xZone\src\libMsg>

	$(WDIR)>C:\pkg\fastDDS\v2.9.1\bin\fastddsgen.bat -ppDisable .\idl\MsgTmp.idl

	output files:

	MsgTmp.cxx/.h: Type definition.
	MsgTmpPubSubType.cxx/.h: Serialization and deserialization source code for the data type. 
                         It also defines the getKey() member function of the MyTypePubSubType 
						 class in case the topic implements keys (see Data types with a key).
						 
linux:
	a) run
		<path/to/Fast DDS-Gen>/scripts/fastddsgen ./idl/MsgTmp.idl
	b) output:	
		MsgTmp.cxx: MsgTmp type definition.
		MsgTmp.h: Header file for MsgTmp.cxx.
		MsgTmpPubSubTypes.cxx: Serialization and Deserialization code for the MsgTmp type.
		MsgTmpPubSubTypes.h: Header file for MsgTmpPubSubTypes.cxx.

@gmihi You can do several things here:

1. Running fastddsgen from a VS command prompt. This way the preprocessor will be on the path.

2. You can pass the path to the preprocessor using argument -ppPath when invoking fastddsgen

3. As you are building HelloWorld.idl, which does not require the preprocessor (as it has no #include), 
   you could use argument -ppDisable when invoking fastddsgen
