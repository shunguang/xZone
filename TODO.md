 - use AppMeanStd.h to profile code
 - write more profile code
 - matlab graph
    - x axis frequency
    - y axis latency (t3-t2)
 - add in config.xml for each sensor frequency (start, step, end) (hertz)
    - start at what frequency to start
    - what step to increment the start
    - when to end the frequency
 - Write GUI
