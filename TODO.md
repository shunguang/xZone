 <!-- - use AppMeanStd.h to profile code
 - write more profile code
 - matlab graph
    - x axis frequency
    - y axis latency (t3-t2)
 - add in config.xml for each sensor frequency (start, step, end) (hertz)
    - start at what frequency to start
    - what step to increment the start
    - when to end the frequency
 - Write GUI 
 -->
 
<!-- - Talk about the graph and what is wrong with it
- Lead into what code needs to be changed

- Ask how frequency works. The application sends x 

- Talk about how graphs should be organized
	- Eg. each machine type has its own graph? Or 3d graph...

<!-- Message frequency
fix horizontal 
remove uncessary configurations

graph key color is weird
standard deviation is a vertical bar

three things in legend
shared memory, tcp, udp

use +, triangles, squares, circles, 

t1 
t2 
t3 

Image.idl

change to 
publisher_send
subscriber_recieve

#1 clean config file
#2 use num and den to determine frequency 
#3 matlib plot, how to plot vertical bar

tcp

magnitude with error bar
plot error bar 

plot the types on type of each other
